    (* integrate (f, a, b, accuracy)
     Integrate the function 'f' between limits 'a' and 'b', to the accuracy
     specified.  If 'accuracy' is NONE then maximum accuracy will be used.
     If either of the limits is infinity or NaN, then Overflow or Div will
     be raised respectively.  If any value in the integral cannot be evaluated
     then Eval will be raised for that point. *)

    (* differentiate f x
     Differentiate the function 'f' at the point 'x'. *)
