 *  -----------
 *  This module demonstrates the use of the Word structure in the basis
 *  library.  It solves the eight queens problem - the problem of determining
 *  how eight queens may be placed on a chessboard such that no queen attacks
 *  another queen.  The solution given here works down the board row by row,
 *  using words to represent the state of the current row.
