 *  This module provides functions to clock the progress of the current

    (* Timer.checkCPUTimer may fail if you deliver the clock function.
       This is because starting a delivered application creates a new
       process, for which any old timers stored in wallClock and cpuClock
       are invalid.  This is why we wrap an exception handler around
       Timer.checkCPUTimer. *)
