# MLWorks 2.0 reboot release

You could get more information at the [development setup](https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mlworks/wiki/Development-Setup) description.
Check the path settings in the registry and batch files! Then enter `mlwks20.reg` into the registry and use the `mlwks20.bat` and 
`mlwks20b.bat` command files to run the program.

Good luck!
